The equipment we have used to build the social arenas includes:

- [ ] **Recording system**: The camera we used was a Manta G-235C from Allied-Vision with a Sony IMX174 CMOS color sensor (any other brand with a similar or more sensitive sensor would work) with a fast F/1.4 lens. The camera was positioned pointing down about one meter above the center of the arena. The camera uses a GigE Vision interface which is based on standard ethernet cables (CAT-6). To record the data we have used Streampix with h264 encoding at 25 fps and 1936 x 1216 resolution (by using binning).
- [ ] **Social box**: The social arena is a 60x60 cm box that included, apart from the walls, a closed nest, two feeders, two water bottles, two ramps, an open shelter, and an S-shaped separation wall in the center. The walls and bases were made from black Poly(methyl methacrylate), also know as PMMA, acrylic, or plexiglass. The PMMA was cut to shape using a laser cutting service. All the enrichments were 3D printed using black PLA (we used a Raise3D Pro2 Plus printer). To prevent the animals from moving the objects, they were secured in place using strong 5x9 magnets.  All the files needed for making the arenas are present in this folder. 
- [ ] **Mice**: The mice were marked with unique hair dyes to distinguish between them. A week prior to the test each mouse was anesthetised with isofluorane, and the dye was applied on their fur using a brush. We used commercially available semi-permanent hair dyes of the following three colors: Pillarbox Red, Voodoo Blue and Sunshine (Tish & Snooky’s NYC). A fourth color, a green hue, was achieved by mixing the latter two dyes. Excess color was removed from the animal’s fur with tissues. The period under anesthesia was typically no longer than 10 min.
- [ ] **Bedding**: We used standard wood chips bedding which was darkened in order to improve the contrast with the mice. We used black food dye which was mixed with the bedding and left to try 48h prior to being autoclaved.
